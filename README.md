# boilerplate-bootstrap-4

This is my basic boilerplate for creating a new project using Bootstrap 4 with Grunt task manager and Sass.<br><br>
**Current Bootstrap version: 4.4.1**


## Get started
1 - Click 'Use this template' on the repository page<br>
> This will create a new repository with all the files from this template

2 - Clone your newly created repository, navigate to your local folder and install Node packages
```
npm install
```

3 - Start grunt task \*
```
grunt
```
It will now watch Sass files and compile CSS

## Requirements
\* Node.js must be installed, and the Grunt command line must be globally installed.
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
